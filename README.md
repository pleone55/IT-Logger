# IT-Logger

Full MERN stack IT-Log inspired application to track department issues. Redux library is implemented to manage the state for a full CRUD application
of logs and technicians. Redux-thunk is implemented to allow asynchronous functions in the application’s actions and to dispatch to the application’s 
reducer for efficient state mangement. Stylized with Materialize for a clean UI.
